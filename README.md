This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The MovieDB API Project

This project was made to pull from the public API at https://api.themoviedb.org/3/.

### Setup

After cloning the repository from Github, navigate to the file folder where the files were cloned to, and run command 'npm start'
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### Using the App

Upon launching the app, you will see the main screen. You can hit the 'Find Some Movies!' button to pull the list of popular movies from the API.
There are page navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen, below the results. Clicking on the 'View Details' button will open a modal with more
relevant info for the movie you have selected.


### Advanced Options

Below the button that launches the API, is a button named 'Advanced Search Options'. Clicking on this will toggle the advnanced options for the
app. There is an input field for setting a 'fake' network delay (timed in seconds). You can set the desired delay, and then click 'Find Some Movies!'
to delay the rendering of movie data from the API.

There is also a filter for movie ratings. Input the desired minimum rating, and click 'Filter Results' to filter out any movies with an average rating
below the input value.

**Thank you for the challenge. I hope you enjoy using the app!**
